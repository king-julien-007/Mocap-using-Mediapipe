# Mocap-using-Mediapipe
This repository provides a lightweight and efficient motion capture (mocap) solution leveraging the Mediapipe library in Python. Mediapipe, developed by Google, is a powerful cross-platform framework designed for processing multimodal data such as video, audio, and sensors. It offers robust tools for real-time pose detection, hand tracking, and facial landmark detection, making it a perfect fit for simple and accessible mocap workflows. By utilizing Mediapipe, this project enables users to extract motion data directly from video input, whether it's a webcam feed or pre-recorded footage, with minimal setup.

The core functionality revolves around extracting pose and skeletal data using Mediapipe's pose estimation models. These models provide 3D coordinates of key body landmarks such as shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees, which are then processed and formatted for use in animation pipelines or analysis. The Python implementation ensures flexibility, allowing users to easily customize the script to suit their needs. Applications include animation prototyping, real-time motion visualization, gesture recognition, and research in human motion analysis.

This solution prioritizes simplicity and accessibility. The lightweight nature of Mediapipe ensures real-time processing even on moderately powerful hardware. With just a few dependencies and a well-documented setup guide, the repository is ideal for developers, researchers, and hobbyists seeking to explore motion capture without investing in expensive hardware or complex software. Additionally, the modular code structure makes it easy to integrate with existing Python-based workflows or extend functionality as needed.

To get started, users only need Python 3.7 or higher and a webcam or video file. The repository includes a step-by-step guide to installing dependencies, running the script, and visualizing motion data. Sample code and visual outputs demonstrate how to extract and interpret skeletal landmarks for various use cases. By combining Mediapipeâ€™s robust tracking capabilities with Python's versatility, this project offers an excellent entry point for anyone interested in motion capture technology.
